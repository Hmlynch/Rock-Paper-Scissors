    "For this project, you will individually create a program that has a \"player\" and a \"computer\" advisary. The computer should randomly choose it's decision based on a list of actions it can take (\"Rock\", \"Paper\" or \"Scissors\"). The player should then have a chance to input their decision. If player and computer choose the same decision then display (\"Game Tied\"), If the player chooses \"Rock\" and the computer chooses \"Paper\" display (\"You lose\"), if the player chooses \"Scissors\" and the computer chooses \"Rock\" display (\"You Lose\") and if the player chooses \"Paper\" and the computer chooses \"Scissors\" then display (\"You lose\") -- Vice versa for other descisions.\n",
